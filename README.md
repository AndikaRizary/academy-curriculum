# Ice House Academy Curriculum

Welcome to the Ice House Academy's curriculum repository! The material included was developed by Ice House to primarily provide teachers with instruction material. However, we feel that the content can be used more widely and may be useful for engineers themselves starting to learn development on the iOS or Android platform. In order to make the content more widely available, we are open sourcing it.

This repo contains beginner and intermediate lessons for learning Android and iOS development. Each lesson contains a markdown file containing an introduction to the topic, guided coding lessons, and additional reading and exercises to try on your own. Additionally, there is a code folder that contains the source code for each lesson. We encourage you to try writing the code on your own first, and reference the finished code if you get stuck.

### Who is this for?
Beginner content is targeted to developers that have a basic understanding of Swift/Kotlin but do not yet have much experience building large applications.

Intermediate content is targeted to developers who are already familiar with Swift/Kotlin and have experience building applications using their platform's common components.
