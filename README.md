# Icehouse Curriculum

Welcome to the Icehouse Academy's curriculum repository! 

This repo contains beginner and intermediate lessons for learning Android and iOS development. Each platform consists of lessons that contain a .md file walking through lesson, along with additional reading and exercises to try on your own. Additionally, there is a code folder that contains the source code for each lesson. We encourage you to write the code on your own first, and reference the finished code if you get stuck or to check your work. 

Please view [android_walkthrough.md](https://github.com/Ice-House-Engineering/academy-curriculum/blob/master/android_walkthrough.md) and [ios_walkthrough.md](https://github.com/Ice-House-Engineering/academy-curriculum/blob/master/ios_walkthrough.md) files for a list of topics and libraries covered in each platform.

Happy learning!<br><br><br>
